### Binary Trees

- Binary trees are hierarchical data structures composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child. The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root node. Nodes that have no children are referred to as leaf nodes. Binary trees are used to store data in a hierarchical manner and are commonly used in computer science for efficient searching, sorting, and retrieval operations. Each node in a binary tree contains a value and pointers to its left and right children, if they exist.
